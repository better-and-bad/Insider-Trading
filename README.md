# Analysis of Business Insider's Conflicted Congress Report

## Overview
This repository contains my analysis of Business Insider's investigative project, Conflicted Congress. The project exposes how members of the U.S. House and Senate have undermined ethical standards, avoided accountability, and created conflicts between their personal financial interests and their public responsibilities. My analysis focuses on unpacking key findings from the report, exploring trends, and presenting data-driven visualizations to highlight systemic issues.

## Source of the Data
The data analyzed in this project originates from Business Insider's Conflicted Congress report. The dataset includes:

Nearly 9,000 financial-disclosure reports from all sitting lawmakers and their top-ranking staffers.

## Goals of the Analysis
